Something that defines me as a person is the **drive to build**. Since I knew how to code basic stuff 
there has not been a week in which I was not working on a project or product that I believed in.
I may have studied **Psychology** instead of Computer Science or Software Engineering, but I think I have 
aquired just as much skill and knowledge though my own **ambition and motivation**  as any graduate there, while additionally having learned how to **motivate and manage people**.

Over the years I have finished a variety of projects ranging from Frontend Website Design, Fullstack App Development to Deep Learning AI Implementation. I have sorted these by complexity, starting from highest complexity and going to lower levels. 

1. [Animaler](): Fullstack Social Media Platform (Ruby on Rails)
2. [Animaler App](): Fullstack Social Media App (Rails API/Flutter)
3. [SnakeAI](): Interactive Browser Snake Game showcasing AI (Javascript/Tensorflow)
4. [Implicity](): Psychological Test for finding biases and stereotypes as mobile App (Flutter)
5. [Forum Family Office Website](): Frontend Design and Implementation for Investment Company (Webflow/Javascript)
6. [Various other AI Projects](): (Python/Tensorflow)
7. [Smaller other Projects](): (Java/Python/Ruby/...)

# Animaler: Fullstack Social Media Platform


# Implicity: Psychological Bias Test as IOS and Android App
## Introduction
Something that fascinated me while studying Psychology was the "Implicit Association Test". This test is a psychological research method to find out what words are connected in a persons mind, which was developed by multiple different psychologists from Harvard and other Universities. 
The way this test works is by finding out which words and images a person connects together in their subconsious mind by letting people sort them and measure their reaction time. The big advantage of this is that the result does not get influenced by the tested persons need to appear positive, as most people dont openly admit their stereotypes. For example, many people connect the word "Asian" and "Smart", or "Muslim" and "Terrorism", as these are the stereotypes and connections that we are shown by our environment and media. With that, it is possible to measure any bias, stereotype and implicit opinion about any object or word.
