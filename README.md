Something that defines me as a person is the **drive to build**. Since I knew how to code basic stuff 
there has not been a week in which I was not working on a project or product that I believed in.
I may have studied **Psychology** instead of Computer Science or Software Engineering, but I think I have 
aquired just as much skill and knowledge though my own **ambition and motivation**  as any graduate there, while additionally having learned how to **motivate and manage people**.

Over the years I have finished a variety of projects ranging from Frontend Website Design, Fullstack App Development to Deep Learning AI Implementation. I have sorted these by complexity, starting from highest complexity and going to lower levels. 

1. [Animaler](#Animaler:-Fullstack-Social-Media-Platform): Fullstack Social Media Platform (Ruby on Rails)
2. [Animaler App](): Fullstack Social Media App (Rails API/Flutter)
3. [SnakeAI](): Interactive Browser Snake Game showcasing AI (Javascript/Tensorflow)
4. [Implicity](): Psychological Test for finding biases and stereotypes as mobile App (Flutter)
5. [Forum Family Office Website](): Frontend Design and Implementation for Investment Company (Webflow/Javascript)
6. [Various other AI Projects](): (Python/Tensorflow)
7. [Smaller other Projects](): (Java/Python/Ruby/...)

# Animaler: Fullstack Social Media Platform
## Description
After finishing my coding Bootcamp "LeWagon" I knew the basics of webdevelopment with the framework Ruby on Rails. Animaler is the third big project that I started with this framework after that, with the first two being smaller projects that did not work out as planned and are no longer online. 
Animaler is a social media platform/imageboard that specializes on the topic of images and videos of animals. The idea behind is that people who enjoy looking at animal pictures and videos for fun or to reduce stress dont want to visit the big platforms like Instagram, Reddit or 9GAG, as they

# Implicity: Psychological Bias Test as IOS and Android App
## Introduction
Something that always interested me was personality tests, and when I leaned about the "Implicit Association Test" while studying Psychology I was really fascinated. This test is a psychological research method to find out what words and constructs are connected in a persons subconscious mind, which was developed by psychologists from Harvard and other prestige Universities. 
The way this test works is by finding out which words and images a person connects together in their subconsious mind by letting people sort them and measure their reaction time. The big advantage of this is that the result does not get influenced by the tested persons need to appear positive to others, as most people dont openly admit their stereotypes. For example, many people connect the word "Asian" and "Smart", or "Muslim" and "Terrorism", as these are the stereotypes and connections that are often shown to us by our environment and media. With this test, it is possible to measure any bias, stereotype and implicit opinion about any object or word. 


## Features
- Working through an online course about the Flutter Framework and practicing coding in Dart.
- Studying various research papers to develop and improve a user friendly concept of the test.
- Constructing different user journeys and experiences.
- Working together with a freelance designer to develop a design that looks **modern, scientific, curious** and **impartial**.
- Coding the backend of the test and result analysis based on the [intitial joural article by Greenwald et al](https://doi.apa.org/doi/10.1037/0022-3514.74.6.1464) that uses ANOVA to calculate the result.
- Improving the statistical test analysis with a [later paper by Nosek et al](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0110938) that improves reliability.
- Setting up a Firestore database to store results and provide anonymous registration so that the data is not connected to the user.
- Implementing real time result average updates, so that every test done affects the global average automatically
- Conducting user tests and collecting feedback from friends, family and by approaching people around my university and libary with standarized interviews.
- Improving App Store Optimization with online articles and freelance consultants.


## Lessons
1. Every coding framework is unique with different perks and flaws, and matching a project with the right framework can save huge amount of time and prevent numerous problems, even if time is needed at the beginning to get used to it.
2. It is incredibly difficult and requires strict standarization to get honest reviews from a users. 
3. The average App Store user is not really interested in scientific testing or psychology. Market research that analyses keyword search volume and app competition is massively important **before** a product is started to be developed. 


## Conclusion
Building Implicity was a great journey and taught me more than any video, book or teacher could ever provide me. The current situation of the app is that its still in the [Appstore](https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/implicity-subconscious-tests/id1587766901) or [Playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vincentwittek.implicity), however getting users by organic serach traffic is difficult as normal consumers are not as interested in finding out their implicit biases as previously thought. There is more potential in B2B markets, as employee testing can help companies to prevent scandals by inequality or sexual harrassment. I am currently in talks with several small organisations that provide workshops about diversity and inclusion, and who are interested in testing participants before and afterwards to measure the effects of the workshop. 

# Forum Family Office Website - Frontend Design and Implementation for Investment Company (Webflow/Javascript)

## Introduction
This project was the result of the internship I visited during my summer holidays of 2021, which was for 8 weeks at the "Forum Family Office", which is a company in my father founded in Germany. The goal was to redesign the website to improve the first impression the clients of the company have as well as to increase customer aquisition through organic search traffic. The website can be found [here](https://en.forumgruppe.de).

## Features
- Comparing several code/no-code frameworks and deciding on Webflow, as it provides advanced customizability, easy CMS usage for future employees and good performance. 
- Analysing key competitors and websites of similar branding to plan the core design.
- Managing the project with KANBAN Methodology  and Trello as tool.
- Planning and analysing potential user journeys 
- Defining three groups of target users, which are potential fond investors (public value investing), company holders looking to sell (private family equity) and job applicants.
- Designing the website according to company image and branding.
- Implementing advanced features through Javascript.
- Satisfying the goals and wishes of multiple stakeholders through constant communication and status updates.
- Reaching top ranks in essential keywords through Search Engine Optimization with several methods (#1 for "Family Office Munich", #3-5 for "Value Investing Job Munich", ...)
- Using automatic translation plugins for translation into English.  

## Lessons
1. Working with multiple stakeholders is not easy, but working with predefined methods (Kanban, Scrum etc) and tools (Trello, Jira etc) and sticking to clear communication helps greatly here.
2. Its important to stay flexible while building a product, as new ideas and potential improvements will come up in every step. 
3.  When working with a fixed time window for the development a clear plan and set structure is the key factor of success. 

## Conclusion
I was skeptical when starting this internship, as I never saw myself as a frontend designer and also because the stakeholders didnt fully trust my ability to manage this project. However, the website turned out to be a great success as the clickcount  and conversionrate is still rising beyond any expectations. Apart from this Forum Family Office is also seeing the first investors and even the first company takeover offers through the contact form.
