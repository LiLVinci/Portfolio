# Portfolio Vincent Wittek

Something that defines me as a person is the **drive to build**. Since I knew how to code basic stuff 
there has not been a week in which I was not working on a project or product that I believed in.
I may have studied **Psychology** instead of Computer Science or Software Design, but I think I have 
aquired just as much skill and knowledge though my own **ambition and motivation**  as any graduate there, while additionally having learned how to **motivate and manage people**.

Over the years I have finished a variety of projects ranging from Frontend Website Design, Fullstack App Development to Deep Learning AI Implementation. I have sorted these by complexity, starting from highest complexity and going to lower levels. 

1. [Animaler](): Fullstack Social Media Platform (Ruby on Rails)
2. [Animaler App](): Fullstack Social Media App (Rails API/Flutter)
3. [SnakeAI](): Interactive Browser Snake Game showcasing AI (Javascript/Tensorflow)
4. [Implicity](): Psychological Test for finding biases and stereotypes as mobile App (Flutter)
5. [Forum Family Office Website](): Frontend Design and Implementation for Investment Company (Webflow/Javascript)
6. [Various other AI Projects](): (Python/Tensorflow)
7. [Smaller other Projects](): (Java/Python/Ruby/...)
