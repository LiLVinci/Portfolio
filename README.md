#  üëã Hi there! This is Vincents Portfolio 

<img align="left" padding="10px" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D03AQFH2-qgzX3IgA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1598911032797?e=1678320000&v=beta&t=22o8lovcrxMx1WizpjCg7pnLBBaNN9G1WsNL7PuKbvY" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something that defines me as a person is the **drive to build**. Since I knew how to code &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;basic stuff there has not been a week in which I was not working on a project or product &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I believed in. I may have studied **Psychology** instead of Computer Science or Software &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engineering, but I think I have  aquired just as much skill and knowledge though my own &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**ambition and motivation**  as any graduate there, while additionally having learned how to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**motivate and manage people**.
&nbsp;&nbsp;

Over the years I have finished a variety of projects ranging from Frontend Website Design, Fullstack App Development to Deep Learning AI Implementation. I have sorted these by complexity, starting from highest complexity and going to lower levels.

# üê± DailyHappyPlace: Fullstack Social Media Platform
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/tQsSCjW/Daily-Happy-Place-Logo1-2.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>
</p>
After finishing my coding Bootcamp "LeWagon" I knew the basics of webdevelopment with the framework Ruby on Rails. Animaler is the third big project that I started with this framework after that, with the first two being smaller projects that did not work out as planned and are no longer online. 
Animaler is a social media platform/imageboard that specializes on the topic of images and videos of animals. The idea behind is that people who enjoy looking at animal pictures and videos for fun or to reduce stress dont want to visit the big platforms like Instagram, Reddit or 9GAG, as its a psychological concept that social communities like these prefer to not mix and have their own space. 
## Features
- PostgresSQL Database
- Cloudinary Image Hosting
- Outsourced frontend design
- Full Responsivity
- Voting System
- Report System
- A/B Testing for user preferred design
- Heroku Hosting
- Automatic publishing to Instagram and Facebook for marketing via watermark
- SEO research and keyword improvements
- Monetarization with Google Adsense

## Lessons
1. It is extremely difficult but also extremely rewarding to build a two sided social network (service providers and consumers)
2. SEO is an interesting concept as there is never a perfect solution and also most experts have different opinions. A good code structure, a low bounce rate and backlinks seem most important
3. Rails is a cool and very useful Framework, but compared to others it can really be seen how old and outdated it is
4. When publishing a project like that one of the most common problems is overengineering it, as building the product is a safespace where its not really possible to fail

## Conclusions
DailyHappyPlace was probably the biggest and most complex project that I ever built. Over years I managed to get a good traction and substantial numbers of users that publish and vote by themselves which of course makes me very proud. 
I want to keep making DailyHappyPlace grow and build an actual community with it. Of course, this takes time but the hardest part is already done. 






# üí° Implicity: Psychological Bias Test as IOS and Android App
<p align="center">
<img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60929e316262b821dd2e1ec7/620076bbde33ea48e04c37cd_logo_full-p-500.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>
</p>
## Introduction
Something that always interested me was personality tests, and when I leaned about the "Implicit Association Test" while studying Psychology I was really fascinated. This test is a psychological research method to find out what words and constructs are connected in a persons subconscious mind, which was developed by psychologists from Harvard and other prestige Universities. 
The way this test works is by finding out which words and images a person connects together in their subconsious mind by letting people sort them and measure their reaction time. The big advantage of this is that the result does not get influenced by the tested persons need to appear positive to others, as most people dont openly admit their stereotypes. For example, many people connect the word "Asian" and "Smart", or "Muslim" and "Terrorism", as these are the stereotypes and connections that are often shown to us by our environment and media. With this test, it is possible to measure any bias, stereotype and implicit opinion about any object or word. 


## Features
- Working through an online course about the Flutter Framework and practicing coding in Dart.
- Studying various research papers to develop and improve a user friendly concept of the test.
- Constructing different user journeys and experiences.
- Working together with a freelance designer to develop a design that looks **modern, scientific, curious** and **impartial**.
- Coding the backend of the test and result analysis based on the [intitial joural article by Greenwald et al](https://doi.apa.org/doi/10.1037/0022-3514.74.6.1464) that uses ANOVA to calculate the result.
- Improving the statistical test analysis with a [later paper by Nosek et al](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0110938) that improves reliability.
- Setting up a Firestore database to store results and provide anonymous registration so that the data is not connected to the user.
- Implementing real time result average updates, so that every test done affects the global average automatically
- Conducting user tests and collecting feedback from friends, family and by approaching people around my university and libary with standarized interviews.
- Improving App Store Optimization with online articles and freelance consultants.


## Lessons
1. Every coding framework is unique with different perks and flaws, and matching a project with the right framework can save huge amount of time and prevent numerous problems, even if time is needed at the beginning to get used to it.
2. It is incredibly difficult and requires strict standarization to get honest reviews from a users. 
3. The average App Store user is not really interested in scientific testing or psychology. Market research that analyses keyword search volume and app competition is massively important **before** a product is started to be developed. 


## Conclusion
Building Implicity was a great journey and taught me more than any video, book or teacher could ever provide me. The current situation of the app is that its still in the [Appstore](https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/implicity-subconscious-tests/id1587766901) or [Playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vincentwittek.implicity), however getting users by organic serach traffic is difficult as normal consumers are not as interested in finding out their implicit biases as previously thought. There is more potential in B2B markets, as employee testing can help companies to prevent scandals by inequality or sexual harrassment. I am currently in talks with several small organisations that provide workshops about diversity and inclusion, and who are interested in testing participants before and afterwards to measure the effects of the workshop.

# üêç SnakeAI: Interactive Browser Snake Game showcasing AI (Javascript/Tensorflow)

## Introduction
After experimenting with basic AI things like Natural Language Processing or Image Recognition I wanted to see how far i could get with programming a deep learning model for a game that I like. After much thought, I decided that the Snake game would be the optimal environment to train my AI, as its easy to program, can be learned with good rules and is also a timeless classic. I started to program three versions of it in a single interactive website: One where the user could test how far they get, one where a "perfect" bot is playing, and one where the AI can be trained.

## Features
- Native Javascript as a framework
- HTML + CSS as design
- Machine Learning using Tensorflow
- Using different amount of layers and neurons for optimal result
- Implementing optimal algorythm for benchmark
- Implementing user controls to compare human and machine

## Lessons
1. Artificial Intelligence has come a long way and can beat humans at things that require basic skills
2. However because of the way deep learning is performed it will almost never reach the optimum solution in a situation where no mistakes are allowed
3. Javascript is powerful for webapplications, however a framework can enhance it even more 

## Conclusion
This was a great project, I learned a lot and applied previous knowledge. Javascript will always be useful in the next decades, so knowing how to do basic things with it is a great plus for me. Next step would be to move to a more complex game like chess and see how far I can get there. 

# üíº Forum Family Office Website - Frontend Design and Implementation for Investment Company (Webflow/Javascript)
<p align="center">
<img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60dedad8c790bfc73c94de1a/60ffc08dc63fc189ef374d6e_Forum_Logo_2021.svg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>
</p>

## Introduction
This project was the result of the internship I visited during my summer holidays of 2021, which was for 8 weeks at the "Forum Family Office", which is a company in my father founded in Germany. The goal was to redesign the website to improve the first impression the clients of the company have as well as to increase customer aquisition through organic search traffic. The website can be found [here](https://en.forumgruppe.de).

## Features
- Comparing several code/no-code frameworks and deciding on Webflow, as it provides advanced customizability, easy CMS usage for future employees and good performance. 
- Analysing key competitors and websites of similar branding to plan the core design.
- Managing the project with KANBAN Methodology  and Trello as tool.
- Planning and analysing potential user journeys 
- Defining three groups of target users, which are potential fond investors (public value investing), company holders looking to sell (private family equity) and job applicants.
- Designing the website according to company image and branding.
- Implementing advanced features through Javascript.
- Satisfying the goals and wishes of multiple stakeholders through constant communication and status updates.
- Reaching top ranks in essential keywords through Search Engine Optimization with several methods (#1 for "Family Office Munich", #3-5 for "Value Investing Job Munich", ...)
- Using automatic translation plugins for translation into English.  

## Lessons
1. Working with multiple stakeholders is not easy, but working with predefined methods (Kanban, Scrum etc) and tools (Trello, Jira etc) and sticking to clear communication helps greatly here.
2. Its important to stay flexible while building a product, as new ideas and potential improvements will come up in every step. 
3.  When working with a fixed time window for the development a clear plan and set structure is the key factor of success. 

## Conclusion
I was skeptical when starting this internship, as I never saw myself as a frontend designer and also because the stakeholders didnt fully trust my ability to manage this project. However, the website turned out to be a great success as the clickcount  and conversionrate is still rising beyond any expectations. Apart from this Forum Family Office is also seeing the first investors and even the first company takeover offers through the contact form.

# ü§ñ Various other AI Projects (Python, Tensorflow, Pytorch)

I very much enjoy learning about the latest findings and developments that are taking place in the world of Artificial Intelligence. In my freetime I also experimented with different simple applications of it to get a better understanding of it. To do this I made use of Python, Tensorflow, Keras, Numpy and Kaggle.
I truly believe that AI is the most promising technology that is currently developing and will bring much more change and opportunity than blockchain, Internet of Things or Virtual Reality. 

## List of Projects
- Handwritten digit recognition
- Recognition of various animals
- Object Recognition trained by Capchta examples
- Sentient Text Analysis of movie reviews
- Text Generation of short stories

# üë®‚Äçüíª Other small projects (Java/Python/Ruby/...)

This list does by far not include all of the projects that I have built. Often I automated day to day tasks or built whole apps that I have as  a personal use for Journal keeping, note keeping or testing myself based on textbook questions. Most of the time I use Python or Flutter, but sometimes if there is a special scenario I will also switch to other Languages or Frameworks that I think are most fitting.
